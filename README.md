## How to deploy canisters implemented in the course

### Ledger canister
`./deploy-local-ledger.sh` - deploys a local Ledger canister. IC works differently when run locally so there is no default network token available and you have to deploy it yourself. Remember that it's not a token like ERC-20 in Ethereum, it's a native token for ICP, just deployed separately.
This canister is described in the `dfx.json`:
```
	"ledger_canister": {
  	"type": "custom",
  	"candid": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/928caf66c35627efe407006230beee60ad38f090/rs/rosetta-api/icp_ledger/ledger.did",
  	"wasm": "https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/928caf66c35627efe407006230beee60ad38f090/canisters/ledger-canister.wasm.gz",
  	"remote": {
    	"id": {
      	"ic": "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"
    	}
  	}
	}
```
`remote.id.ic` - that is the principal of the Ledger canister and it will be available by this principal when you work with the ledger.

Also, in the scope of this script, a minter identity is created which can be used for minting tokens
for the testing purposes.
Additionally, the default identity is pre-populated with 1000_000_000_000 e8s which is equal to 10_000 * 10**8 ICP.
The decimals value for ICP is 10**8.

List identities:
`dfx identity list`

Switch to the minter identity:
`dfx identity use minter`

Transfer ICP:
`dfx ledger transfer <ADDRESS>  --memo 0 --icp 100 --fee 0`
where:
 - `--memo` is some correlation id that can be set to identify some particular transactions (we use that in the marketplace canister).
 - `--icp` is the transfer amount
 - `--fee` is the transaction fee. In this case it's 0 because we make this transfer as the minter idenity thus this transaction is of type MINT, not TRANSFER.
 - `<ADDRESS>` is the address of the recipient. To get the address from the principal, you can use the helper function from the marketplace canister - `getAddressFromPrincipal(principal: Principal)`, it can be called via the Candid UI.


### Internet identity canister

`dfx deploy internet_identity` - that is the canister that handles the authentication flow. Once it's deployed, the `js-agent` library will be talking to it to register identities. There is UI that acts as a wallet where you can select existing identities
or create a new one.

### Marketplace canister

`dfx deploy dfinity_js_backend` - deploys the marketplace canister where the business logic is implemented.
Basically, it implements functions like add, view, update, delete, and buy products + a set of helper functions.

Do not forget to run `dfx generate dfinity_js_backend` anytime you add/remove functions in the canister or when you change the signatures.
Otherwise, these changes won't be reflected in IDL's and won't work when called using the JS agent.

### Marketplace frontend canister
`dfx deploy dfinity_js_frontend` - deployes the frontend app for the `dfinity_js_backend` canister on IC.
